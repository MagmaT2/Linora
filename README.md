# Linora ü¶ä

**Linora** is a custom Linux-like console environment for Windows, designed to provide a seamless and customizable experience for running Linux commands, managing files, and interacting with AI (via Ollama). It combines the power of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with a user-friendly interface and a cute fox mascot named Orry.
